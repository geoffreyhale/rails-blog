# README

To start a web server on your development machine:

```
bin/rails server
```

This will fire up Puma, a web server distributed with Rails by default.

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3000.  You should see the Rails default information page.  The "Welcome aboard" page is the _smoke test_ for a new Rails application: it makes sure that you have your software configured correctly enough to serve a page.
